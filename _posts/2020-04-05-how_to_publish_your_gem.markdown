We can build and publish our gem in a few steps.

After we have written our code, our command line interface(CLI) and inspected it, we are ready to upload it (https://rubygems.org).

Today we will be updating, creating and publishing a Ruby Gem. We currently are in version 0.1.3.gem.

In order to update this gem we need to change the Version, to a higher number preferably.

Once we have manually change the version number, run this command:   
   "gem build insert-name"

At this point our gem has been created, I recommend taking the time to visit "rubygems.org" where our gem will be pushed/uploaded to. Create and register an account, you will need it while pushing via command line.
