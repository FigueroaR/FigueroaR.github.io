This is a quick guide to get your repo verified on  [Github](http://gihub.com).


First step is to enter Github and create your repo, name it anything you want!

Second step is to choose a license, without a license, our repo will not get verified. 
The one I always pick is the "MIT License". With this option anyone can use or code, but they have no guarantee.


Finally click on "create repository". Now in your commits, you will see a verified tag!

Congrats your repo is official now! Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/cjBNjyX1rZ4) demonstration.
